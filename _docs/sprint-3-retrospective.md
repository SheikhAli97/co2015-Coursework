Sprint 3 Retrospective:

In Sprint 3 we improved from the retrospective produced in sprint 2, splitting up our stories at the start of
sprint 3 in our stand up meeting. Front-end work was delegated to Chester with Back-End and Security delegated to
Mohamed and Ben. Testing was handled mostly by the rest of the team.

Improvements over preceding Sprints:
+ Source Control more effective through use of smaller commits
+ Checkstyle followed well with useful comments
+ User stories re-arranged to guide the progression of the app more chronologically
  (i.e. the new arrangement of remaining user stories makes more sense)
+ Team members worked more towards their strengths

Improvements to make:
- Pivotal tracker was updated but not as consistently as it should have been.
There was a gap for a few days with no commits while the login database was established,
in future we should use branches to allow for progress to made elsewhere simultaneously.
- Minor bugs found in small areas of usability, manual testing could be more rigorous.
- Schedule additional meetings to establish clarity about the progress each member is
making on their user story. There were areas of difficulty which could have been helped
through teamwork.
