Sprint 4 Retrospective
---------------------

For our final sprint I believe we made siginificant improvements from the preceding sprints. We maintained a steady schedule with our stand up meetings and unlike last sprint, work was carried out from start to finish and we were able to complete a working product that was close to the specification we invisioned at the start of this project. 

Improvements over preceding Sprints:
---------------------------------------
+ Pivotal Tracker was used more consistently with more detail logged.
+ Manual Testing was deployed more effectively.
+ User Stories were organized much more chronologically 

Things we missed:
-----------------
+ Participation wasn't as good as other Sprints. Developers had to take on others' roles to ensure a finished product was produced.


Final Note - Things we learnt:
------------------------------------------
+ When you work from start to finish, it is much easier to track progress and maintain Pivotal Tracker. By working systematically people work to their strengths and there is a lot less stress approaching the end of a Sprint thus making the end result of a story more polished.
+ Through rigorous initial manual testing, automated tests can be written more easily and bugs are spotten much quicker.
+ It is important to work to people's strengths and use each other - if someone get's stuck on a feature then it is likely they will get demotivated and their work output decreases rapidly - communication is key.
