Our Approach to Source Control:

Weekly meetings at Monday 12-2pm to discuss possible branching and our understanding of how the application is progressing (keep everyone up-to-date).

Stick to small commits of well-commented code which is ensured through the use of checkstyle's - a build will fail unless it is commented properly.

All documents stored in _docs.

Updating Pivotal Tracker when significant changes are made to a user story's development.

Each sprint is added as a new release in GitHub.
